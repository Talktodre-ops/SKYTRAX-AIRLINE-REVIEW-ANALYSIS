 Customer Booking Prediction for British Airways

 # Customer Booking Prediction for British Airways

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a customer will complete a booking for British Airways using historical customer behavior and flight data. The goal is to identify key drivers of bookings and provide actionable insights to improve revenue and customer targeting strategies.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset
- **Size**: 50,000 entries with 14 original features (expanded to 42 after preprocessing).
- **Key Features**:
  - `num_passengers`, `purchase_lead`, `flight_duration`, `route`, `booking_origin`, etc.
  - Target Variable: `booking_complete` (binary: 0 = Not Booked, 1 = Booked).
- **Class Distribution**: 
  - **85%**: Not Booked (Class 0)
  - **15%**: Booked (Class 1)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Imbalance**: Techniques like `class_weight="balanced"` and `BalancedBaggingClassifier`.
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - Created `last_minute_booking` (bookings ‚â§ 7 days before departure).
  - Encoded categorical variables (`sales_channel`, `trip_type`, `flight_day`).

### 2. Model Training
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest (baseline) + Balanced Bagging Classifier.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search for optimal `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, etc.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

## üìä Results
### Key Metrics (Random Forest):
| Metric      | Class 0 (Not Booked) | Class 1 (Booked) | Overall     |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Accuracy**| -                    | -                | **84.19%**  |
| **Precision**| 0.87                | 0.44             | -           |
| **Recall**  | 0.95                 | **0.20**         | -           |
| **ROC-AUC** | -                    | -                | **0.777**   |

### Classification Report:
           precision    recall  f1-score   support
       0       0.87      0.95      0.91      8504
       1       0.44      0.20      0.28      1496

## üö® Challenges
1. **Severe Class Imbalance**: 85% of customers did not complete bookings.
2. **Low Recall for Bookings**: The model misses **80% of actual bookings** (critical for revenue).
3. **Precision-Recall Trade-off**: High precision for non-bookings but low precision for bookings.

---

## üí° Recommendations
1. **Target High-Intent Customers**:
   - Focus on features like `purchase_lead` (short lead times) and `flight_duration` (long-haul flights).
2. **Campaign Optimization**:
   - Use insights from feature importance to design personalized offers (e.g., discounts for early bookings).
3. **Model Improvements**:
   - Combine SMOTE oversampling with ensemble methods to boost recall.
   - Adjust classification thresholds to prioritize capturing bookings.

## üìà Feature Importance
Top predictors of bookings:
1. **`purchase_lead`** (Time between booking and departure)
2. **`flight_duration`** (Longer flights correlate with bookings)
3. **`last_minute_booking`** (Critical for urgent travelers)
